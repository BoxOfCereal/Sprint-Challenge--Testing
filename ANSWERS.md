In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?

Describe is used to describe a suite of tests, and it is used to describe unit tests or singular tests of a single function.

What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?

the point of test driven development is to be help clarify exactly what you want to happen,
and to make sure that it does happen exactly to a specification. I like testdriven Development
because it gives me an extra sanity check to make sure that my logic is correct.
oftentimes I would check something and then change something and get a regression,
that would end up slowing things down because I would have to go back and fix it.

Mention three types of automated tests.
There's unit testing, snapshot testing, and end to end testing.
There's also integrated testing which it means combining things to make sure the whole System Works
